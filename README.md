# Magic 6Ball
I chose the 6th ball of pool to name the project after because it is green just like Qt's logo. If this was a KDE project I would've definately named it Magic PlasmaBall!

Use `QT_FONT_DPI` to scale the UI, for example `QT_FONT_DPI=150 ./app_magic6ball`

## Commands
- `Ctrl+Shift+N` or `!new` το create a new chat session
- `Ctrl+Shift+R` or `!clear` to clear the chat window but continue on the same session
- `!add` to append a new answer to the local `answers.txt`
- `Up` to move the cursor to position 0 if there's text or edit the previous message if there isn't
- `Down` to move the cursor at the end
